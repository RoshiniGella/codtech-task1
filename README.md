objective:
To create an engaging and interactive quiz application that enables users to test their knowledge on various topics, offering a seamless and visually appealing experience. The application should be user-friendly, responsive, and include features for tracking performance and providing feedback.
  
    Key Activities:1. Planning and Design  
   - Define the purpose and scope of the quiz application.  
   - Create wireframes or prototypes to design the user interface.  
   - Plan user flow (e.g., quiz start, question navigation, scoring, feedback).  
2. Development  
   - Build the quiz layout using HTML for structure.  
   - Style the application using CSS to ensure a visually appealing design.  
   - Use JavaScript to add interactivity . 
3. Features Implementation  
   - Dynamic Question Loading: Fetch questions from an array or external JSON file.  
   - Answer Validation: Verify answers and provide immediate feedback.  
   - Progress Tracker: Display current progress (e.g., question X out of Y).  
   - Results Screen: Show scores and detailed feedback at the end.
     
      Key Technologies used:
